#' @description
#' Advances the population by one year; increases age by one year and aggregates
#' people aged 100 and older.
#'
#' @param .data data frame including the starting population of each
#' demographic group; either the initial population or the previous projected
#' year. Possible identifiers are the same as in `parameters` (apart from year).
#' The data frame only includes one year, usually the one preceding the first
#' projected year.
#'    * `year` numeric
#'    * `spatial_unit` character.
#'    * `nat` character.
#'    * `sex` character.
#'    * `age` numeric.
#'    * `n_dec` numeric, number of people per demographic group in December.
#'
#' @return returns an identically structured data frame with the aged population.
#' @export
#' @autoglobal
