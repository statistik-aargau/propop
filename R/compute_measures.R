#' Compute evaluation measures
#'
#' Uses the differences between the results from a projection and
#' a benchmark to compute performance measures.
#'
#' The input is a data frame created with `propop::prepare_evaluation()`.
#' It includes a benchmark (typically the observed population records, i.e.,
#' the number of people per spatial unit, demographic group, and year) and
#' the corresponding projected number of people. The input can range from
#' low resolution (e.g., total number of people per municipality) to
#' high resolution (e.g., 101 age classes, nationality, sex).
#'
#' For more details on usage, see
#' \code{vignette("evaluate", package = "propop")}.
#'
#' @param combined data frame created with `propop::prepare_evaluation()`.
#' @param weight_groups character, optional argument indicating one or more
#' column names to obtain evaluation criteria weighted for specific groups
#' (e.g., age groups, nationality).
#'
#' @returns
#' A data frame. The following evaluation criteria can directly be interpreted
#' and used for descriptive comparisons:
#'
#'* `error` is the forecast error; it quantifies the level of under-projection
#' (negative values) and over-projection (positive values) relative to the
#' benchmark `n_benchmark`.
#'
#'* `pe` is the percentage error and expresses the under- / over-projection
#'in percent of the benchmark `n_benchmark`.
#'
#'* `ape` is the absolute percentage error; it is the absolute deviation
#' in percent of the benchmark `n_benchmark`, thus only showing the extent of the
#' error but not the direction.
#'
#' * `w_ape` is the weighted absolute percentage error; it weighs each
#' absolute percentage error according to the population size of the focal group
#' (e.g., nationality, age group). The weighted version is useful as an
#' aggregated measure when groups vary strongly in terms of population size.
#' Only returned when the argument `weight_groups` contains at least one
#' grouping variable.
#'
#'
#' The following helper variables are used to compute aggregate measures. They
#' are only returned when weight groups are provided via the argument
#' `weight_groups`.
#'
#'
#'* `n_tot` is the total number of people (i.e., sum of the number of people in
#' all demographic groups); used to compute the weighted absolute percentage
#' error.
#'
#'* `group_tot` is the number of people in the focal group; used to compute the
#' weighted absolute percentage error.
#'
#'* `weight` is the share of the (optional) focal group (e.g., municipality type
#' / size, nationality, age group) relative to all people; used to compute the
#' weighted absolute percentage error.
