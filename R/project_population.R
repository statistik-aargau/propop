#' Project population development
#'
#' @description
#' This function is applied within the wrapper function `propop_tables()`
#' to iterate across years. An example is currently in development;
#' see script: dev/run_propop_tables.R
#'
#' The calculations involve three helper functions:
#' * `advance_population()`: Advances the population by one year (increases
#'    age by one year and aggregates people aged 100 and older).
#' * `calculate_projection()`: Calculates the projection for ages 1-100. Follows
#'   the method from the FSO.
#' * `calculate_newborns()`: Calculate newborns per demographic group.
#'
#' @param population data frame including the starting population of each
#' demographic group; either the initial population or the previous projected
#' year. Possible identifiers are the same as in `parameters` (apart from year).
#' The data frame only includes one year, usually the one preceding the first
#' projected year.
#'    * `year` numeric
#'    * `spatial_unit` character.
#'    * `nat` character.
#'    * `sex` character.
#'    * `age` numeric.
#'    * `n_dec` numeric, number of people per demographic group in December.
#' @param parameters list, data frames containing the FSO rates and numbers to
#' run the projection for a specific spatial level (e.g., canton, municipality).
#' @param fert_first numeric, first year of female fertility. Defaults to 16
#'        (FSO standard value).
#' @param fert_last numeric, last year of female fertility. Defaults to 50
#'        (FSO standard value).
#' @param share_born_female numeric, fraction of female babies. Defaults to
#'        100 / 205 (FSO standard value).
#'
#' @return
#' Returns a data frame that includes the number of people for each demographic
#'      group per year (for projected years) and spatial unit. The number of
#'      rows is the product of all years times all demographic groups times
#'      all spatial units.
#'      The output includes several \bold{identifiers} that indicate to which
#'      demographic group, year, and spatial unit the results in the rows refer
#'      to:
#'      \item{year}{integer, indicating the projected years.}
#'      \item{spatial_unit}{factor, spatial units for which the projection
#'            was run (e.g., canton, districts, municipalities).}
#'      \item{age}{integer, ranging from `0`n to `100` (including those older
#'      than 100).}
#'      \item{sex}{factor, female (f) and male (m).}
#'      \item{nat}{factor, indicates if the nationality is Swiss (ch) or
#'      international / foreign (int). This variable is only returned if
#'      `binational = TRUE`.}
#'      The output also includes columns related to the \bold{size and change
#'      of the population:}
#'      \item{n_jan}{numeric, start-of-year population per demographic group.}
#'      \item{n_dec}{numeric, end-of-year population per demographic group.}
#'      The \bold{components} that are used to project the development of the
#'      population are also included in the output:
#'      \item{births}{numeric, number of births (non-zero values are only
#'      available for age = 0).}
#'      \item{mor_n}{numeric, number of deaths.}
#'      \item{emi_int}{numeric, number of people who emigrate
#'      to other countries.}
#'      \item{emi_nat_n}{numeric, number of people who emigrate
#'      to other cantons.}
#'      \item{imm_int_n}{numeric, number of people who immigrate
#'      from other countries.}
#'      \item{imm_nat_n}{numeric, number of people who immigrate
#'      from other cantons.}
#'      \item{acq_n}{numeric, number of people who acquire Swiss citizenship.}
