# propop 1.3.0
- Uses new scenarios published by the FSO in April 2025
- Updated functions, package data, and documentation 

# propop 1.2.1
- `get_population`: Using clearer, more intuitive name for argument to specify
start year; less typing for users; 
- revised function documentation
- More detailed feedback after running propop::propop(), stating which arguments 
were used)

# propop 1.2.0

- Added function `calculate_shares` to distribute FSO estimates expressed as 
"number of people" among sub-cantonal entitities (e.g., immigration to 
municipalities). 

# propop 1.1.0

- Added unit test that fails if projection outcomes differ from FSO projections
- Increased flexibility of `prepare_evaluation()` by offering possibility to 
indicate which column contains the population (rather than assuming it's 
called `n`). 

# propop 1.0.0

## Projection using separate parameters for migration between cantons

- `propop::propop()` now uses *separate* input parameters for emigration to / 
immigration from other cantons. Previously `propop::propop()` used the net 
difference between emigration to / immigration from other cantons. 
- With this change, the new version now directly corresponds to the projection 
equations provided by the FSO.
- The change has also facilated the inclusion of all components of the cohort
component method in the output. This makes it easy to track the transition from 
one year to the next.

## New variable names

- This change required a comprehensive renaming of several variables, which makes
the new version incompatible with previous code. 
- If you want to continue using 
old code, we suggest using version 0.2.0. Note that the components of the 
projection equation are not included in the output in version 0.2.0.

# propop 0.2.0

## Projection without distinction of nationalities

- If desired, projections can be run for only one nationality (no longer
required to provide two nationalities).   
- `propop::propop()` returns a plain text feedback in the console summarizing 
the settings used to run the projection.  

# propop 0.1.0

## Development history and earlier versions

The `propop` package is a successor of `staagBevProj` (not publicly available), 
which was last updated in December 2022. `staagBevProj` was developed by 
Tina Cornioley, Jan Wunder, and Niklas Haffert. As head of [Official Statistics 
Aargau](https://www.ag.ch/de/verwaltung/dfr/statistik), Andrea Pl√ºss supported 
the devlopment as well as the 
publication of `staagBevProj` and `propop`.

`propop` was developed by Norah Efosa and Adrian Gadient 
([Statistik Aargau](https://www.ag.ch/de/verwaltung/dfr/statistik)). 
The main innovations are:

- Clearer separation between code that prepares data and code that runs the 
projection
-	Centrally united FSO parameters and corrections / adjustments; these are now 
gathered in a single data frame that is passed to the projection function
-	Only one function to run projections (rather than `projectPop` and 
`projectAll`)
-	Convenience functions to directly download data and parameters from STAT-TAB
-	Incorporation of assertions and unit tests
-	Function to evaluate projection results 
-	Clearer documentation
