\title{Compute evaluation measures}
\usage{
compute_measures(combined, weight_groups = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{combined}{data frame created with \code{propop::prepare_evaluation()}.}

\item{weight_groups}{character, optional argument indicating one or more
column names to obtain evaluation criteria weighted for specific groups
(e.g., age groups, nationality).}
}
\value{
A data frame. The following evaluation criteria can directly be interpreted
and used for descriptive comparisons:
\itemize{
\item \code{error} is the forecast error; it quantifies the level of under-projection
(negative values) and over-projection (positive values) relative to the
benchmark \code{n_benchmark}.
\item \code{pe} is the percentage error and expresses the under- / over-projection
in percent of the benchmark \code{n_benchmark}.
\item \code{ape} is the absolute percentage error; it is the absolute deviation
in percent of the benchmark \code{n_benchmark}, thus only showing the extent of the
error but not the direction.
\item \code{w_ape} is the weighted absolute percentage error; it weighs each
absolute percentage error according to the population size of the focal group
(e.g., nationality, age group). The weighted version is useful as an
aggregated measure when groups vary strongly in terms of population size.
Only returned when the argument \code{weight_groups} contains at least one
grouping variable.
}

The following helper variables are used to compute aggregate measures. They
are only returned when weight groups are provided via the argument
\code{weight_groups}.
\itemize{
\item \code{n_tot} is the total number of people (i.e., sum of the number of people in
all demographic groups); used to compute the weighted absolute percentage
error.
\item \code{group_tot} is the number of people in the focal group; used to compute the
weighted absolute percentage error.
\item \code{weight} is the share of the (optional) focal group (e.g., municipality type
/ size, nationality, age group) relative to all people; used to compute the
weighted absolute percentage error.
}
}
\description{
Uses the differences between the results from a projection and
a benchmark to compute performance measures.
}
\details{
The input is a data frame created with \code{propop::prepare_evaluation()}.
It includes a benchmark (typically the observed population records, i.e.,
the number of people per spatial unit, demographic group, and year) and
the corresponding projected number of people. The input can range from
low resolution (e.g., total number of people per municipality) to
high resolution (e.g., 101 age classes, nationality, sex).

For more details on usage, see
\code{vignette("evaluate", package = "propop")}.
