<p><code>propop</code> provides a function to <strong>compare
projections against a benchmark</strong>. The benchmark can be the
actual (recorded) population development (i.e., official records in
population registry) or a base model (e.g., when testing alternative
models or when comparing against the official FSO forecast).</p>
<p>Evaluations can be carried out individually <strong>per observation
unit</strong> or like a summary statistics <strong>aggregated across
observations</strong> (e.g., all years, demographic groups, spatial
units).</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="get-the-data">Get the data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#get-the-data"></a>
</h3>
<p>To run the evaluation function, we need some benchmark data and the
results from the projection. An interesting possibility is to compare
real, observed data to predicted data. Because FSO’s projection
scenarios have just been published, there aren’t any observed data
available yet.</p>
<p>This example therefore uses older data and parameters from the
previous FSO model. That is, we run a model with the population from
2018 as starting population and the <strong>population records</strong>
from 2019-2022 as benchmark data.</p>

<p>Let’s first compare the projected population growth against the
recorded population development (= benchmark) using one-year age classes
(default option). Make sure to provide matching data frames, especially
in terms of the year ranges and spatial units. To remove the starting
population (2018) from the projection results, you could also use
<code>drop_start_year = TRUE</code>.</p>
<p>As a result of <code><a href="../reference/prepare_evaluation.html">prepare_evaluation()</a></code>, you get the
recorded (<code>n_bench</code>) and projected (<code>n_proj</code>)
population for each demographic group and year as data frame columns
next to each other:</p>

<p>One-year age classes often lead to small group sizes. This is
particularly problematic when the benchmark is equal to 0; then some
measures may be inaccurate.</p>
<p>A solution to this problem is to use larger age groups that contain
several years.</p>

<p>Instead of using one-year age classes, you can conduct the evaluation
for the commonly used age groups 0-19 year olds, 20-64 year olds, and

<p>Furthermore, you can use weights. When using the weighted metric,
adjusted absolute percentage errors weigh less heavily in smaller groups
than in larger groups. The adjusted metric <code>w_ape</code> considers
that smaller groups tend to have larger forecast errors.</p>
<p>This is illustrated in the following table: The unweigthed percentage
errors (<code>ape</code>) 0.39/0.36 become 0.24/0.07 when they are
weighted by the total number of people per group
(<code>w_ape</code>).</p>

<p>In the example data, the differences are as much as 30 person per
demographic group. The main reason for these differences is that FSO
uses a different starting population, which mainly differs for newborns
and old people.</p>
<p>When using the exact same starting population, which is not publicly
available, the largest difference between the FSO projections and those
from {propop} is just one person across all 404 demographic groups and
31 years.</p>
