algebra to project population development. The function can be used for
different spatial levels (e.g., cantons, municipalities) and for one scenario
at a time.
This function provides projections in a raw version in which
key information is missing (e.g., which age groups the rows represent).
To conveniently obtain an enriched, more informative output,
use the wrapper function propop::propop() (which internally uses
propop::project_raw()).
The parameters and starting populations for different spatial levels
can be obtained from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (FSO).

STAT-TAB,

vignette(&quot;prepare_data&quot;, package = &quot;propop&quot;).
The projection parameters need to be passed on as a single data frame to
project_raw with (with the parameters as columns). The column types, names,
and factor levels need to match those specified below.
The method used to calculate the projections is a 'cohort-component
analysis' implemented with matrices due to programming performance benefit
compared to data frames. In a nutshell, the starting population ('n') is
multiplied by the survival rate to obtain the number of people which
transition into the projected next year (year + 1). Then, the absolute
number of people immigrating from outside Switzerland and the migration saldo
for people from outside the respective canton is added to the surviving
population. This results in the starting population for projection the next
year. Newborn children are added aeparately to the new starting population
of each year.
The starting population is clustered in 404 groups: 101 age groups times
two nationalities times 2 genders. The survival rate is calculated in the
function 'create_transition_matrix()' resulting in the matrix 'L'. We use the
rates for mortality, emigration towards countries outside Switzerland and the
rate for the acquisition of the Swiss citizenship by the foreign population
to calculate survival rates. The model from the FSO also includes the rate of
emigration to other cantons in the survival rate. In contrast, we include the
immi- and emigration from and to other cantons by adding the migration
balance (German = 'saldo') (immigration + emigration) afterwards.
Steps in this function:
Checks: Checking input data and parameter settings for correct formats.
Data preparation: Preparing vectors e.g. for the projection time frame and
creating empty vectors to be filled with data later on.
Loop over years for calculating the projections
Subsetting parameters: Depending on the selected projection year and on
the demographic unit, the parameters for mortality, fertility, acquisition
of the Swiss citizenship as well as migration parameters are subset by
demographic group.
Create matrices: Matrices are build for the survival rate, mortality,
fertility and for calculating the number of newborn babies.
Creating vectors: Vectors are built for mortality and migration parameters.
Projection: The transition matrix 'L' is multiplied by the starting
population for the next year. Migrating people are added in absolute
numbers. People that are 100 years old and older are clustered into one
age group (age = 100). The newborn babies are added to the resulting
starting population for the next projection year.

Aggregating the data: All projected years are aggregated into one data
frame. The function 'propop()', in which this function is contained,
automatically adds relevant meta data to the results.
